## How to setup

> You can run this on heroku. Make sure to make a `config.py`

1. Make a bot [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and grab the token![Image_Example1](https://i.alexflipnote.dev/f9668b.png)

2. Rename the file **config.py.example* to **config.py**, then fill in the required spots, such as token, prefix and game

3. To install what you need, do 
    ```ps
    # Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    ```bash
    # bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    `[!NOTE]: Use pip install with Administrator/sudo`


4. Start the bot by having the cmd/terminal inside the bot folder and type 

    `python index.py`

5. You're done, enjoy your bot!
